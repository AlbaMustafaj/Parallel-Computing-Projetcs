# Parallel-Computing-Projetcs
There are 4 projects developed as following:
1 & 2 with MPI
3 with OpenMP 
4 with CUDA

------Project 1 implemented in C using MPI---------

Part A: FIND MAX
Part B: IMAGE SMOOTHING

----Project 2 implemented in C using MPI-----

In this project, a parallel document search system is implemented.


----Project 3 implemented in C++ using OpenMP-----

In this project,  parallel face recognition algorithm using idea of Local Binary
Patterns is implemented.
Local Binary Patterns is a simple but effective idea in texture analysis. 
It is also used for face recognition and gesture recognition applications.

----Project 4 Using CUDA-----

Find angle between vectors
