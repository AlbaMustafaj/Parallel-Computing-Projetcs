Angle between Two Vectors on GPU: A  program to find the angle between two vectors
using both CPU and GPU implementation will be implemented. Execution times of CPU code 
and GPU code will be compared.

Array generator code which will create two integer arrays with N
elements. 
Firstly CPU code to find the angle between 2 vectors is implemented.
Secondly, parallel GPU code to find the angle between 2 vectors is implemented.
