Training Step:
For each image in the dataset,  the following steps are applied:
• For each pixel in an i m a g e ,  pixel are compared with its 8 neighbors (on its left-top, leftmiddle,
left-bottom, right-top, etc.). 
• Where the center pixel's value is less than the neighbor's value, "1". Otherwise,  "0".
• Value is converted into a decimal value.
• Histogram is computed, over the pixels, of the frequency of each "number" occurring (i.e.,
each combination of which pixels are smaller and which are greater than the center).

Test Step:
• Histogram for the test image are generated as described previously.
• Distance values between test image's histogram and training histograms are computed.
• Closest training histogram to determine the person is selected.
• Results are displayed
